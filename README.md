00. Prolog One Dimensional Automata 
* Goal: Using prolog, implement a one dimensional automata for experimentation with Turing completeness
* Rule 110 is one exapmle of an elementary cellular automata that is Turing complete

01. Prolog Supermemo 2 Algorithm
* Goal: Using prolog, build a REST webserver with a JS/HTML front end that allows users to interact with the supermemo 2 algorithm
* There are more advanced implementations of supermemo, but supermemo 2 captures the majority of the efficacy of the spaced repetition pattern
* This is interesting, REST calls from html/javascript can be aimed at any back-end. For some reason I had never considered using a declarative back-end like this. I had always thought an app would need a LAMP stack (or equivalent) with a middle piece written in something more normal that fronts a declarative language (I.E. facade pattern). 

02. Prolog Neural Networks
* Goal: Using prolog, implement a simple algorithm for neural networks
* I guess this is also AKA deep learning. Still seems weird to me to call them that... I guess it's pithier than 'unsupervised training on a neural network with multiple hidden layers' or whatever particular configuration applies.
* I initially tried to implement this more like what we did in my masters program, and that wound up being wonky because it was all imperative, a neural network is far closer to a function than I realized initially. So I'm re-doing some of this one in a more declarative way.

03. Genetic Algorithms
* Goal: Using prolog implement a system for testing and evolving a simple genetic algorithm
* This one has languished a bit (the neural networks one wound up being a bit more interesting) and I still haven't gotten around to doing the initial commit, which I should do sometime... I have a test bed ready to go and that's useful enough to not lose.

04. Tinkering in Assembly 
* Goal: Learn to use x86 assembly to implement some simple functions. 
* This brings back some fond memories of playing with MIPS in college. Insert data and pull the syscall lever. 

05. Operating System
* Goal: Using x86 assembly peice together a basic operating system for a better understanding of low level systems
* This could eat up a ton of time if I let it... maybe not too deep past the boot loader for now.
